---Ideas---

>Edit todos DONE

>Remove completed todos DONE (But need to understand how this got done.)

>Add input validation so that cannot enter empty string

>Add support for categories? or something like labels (inspiration from google keep.)

>Sync across multiple devices? So some kind of login and then I will need a backend too.?

>Move checked items to the bottom of the list?

>Priorities?

>Make it more aesthetic?


Thoughts.
